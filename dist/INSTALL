Basic instructions for installing signman-server on a Linux
system. They mau need some adjustment for your system.

First you may need to configure your system for SPI and GPIO
access. On a Raspberry Pi, this may involve adding the following line
to /boot/firmware/config.txt:

dtparam=spi=on

It may also be desirable to disable the Raspberry Pi LED if used with
a translucent enclosure:

dtparam=act_led_trigger=off

Next, install dependencies. On Debian variants, that might look like this:

# apt install --install-recommends default-jdk-headless build-essential

Next, add a user and group for signman:

# adduser --system --group --home /home/signman signman
# usermod --groups spi,gpio signman

Now you will need to create configuration and password files based on
the provided examples. Once the files have been created, install them
using commands similar to the following:

# install -m 400 -o signman -g signman signman.passwd /etc/
# install -m 444 -o 0 -g 0 signman.conf /etc/

Next build the native library:

$ make

Then install everything:

# make install

Finally, enable and start the server:

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl enable signman.socket signman.service
# systemctl start signman.service

It may take some time to start, especially on a slow machine. Check
the status with systemctl status signman.service and then verify with
a web browser.
